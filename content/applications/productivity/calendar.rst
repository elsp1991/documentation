Odoo Calendar is a scheduling app that allows users to integrate a company’s business flow into a
single management platform. By integrating with the other apps in Odoo’s ecosystem, Calendar allows
users to schedule meetings, organize meetings, schedule events, plan employee appraisals,
coordinate projects, and more – all from the same platform.

In the **Calendar** app, users have an overview of their current meetings. The selected view option
will appear as a :guilabel:`Day`, :guilabel:`Week`, :guilabel:`Month`, or :guilabel:`Year` button.
Under the view options, users can also enable or disable :guilabel:`Show weekends`.

Depending on the selected view option, users can use the arrow buttons to switch between days, weeks
, etc., then switch back to the current day with the :guilabel:`Today` button.

Sync third-party calendars
--------------------------

Users can sync Odoo with existing :doc:`Outlook <calendar/outlook>` and/or :doc:`Google
<calendar/google>` calendars by heading to :menuselection:`Calendar --> Configuration --> Settings`.
Events created in synced calendars will automatically appear across the integrated platforms.

Create Calendar activities from chatter
---------------------------------------

Instantly create new meetings anywhere in Odoo through an individual record’s chatter, like
in a CRM opportunity card or Project Task.

From chatter, click on the :guilabel:`Activities` button. In the new :guilabel:`Schedule Acitivity`
window, select :guilabel:`Activity Type`, which will populate a set of smart buttons depending on
the activity. Activities that would involve other attendees' schedules like :guilabel:`Meeting` or
:guilabel:`Call for Demo` will link to **Calendar** app.
